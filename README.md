This repository is the home of the [Web Telephony API](http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/telephony/) specification being worked on by the [System Applications Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/).

## What's in here? 

The [Web Telephony API](http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/telephony/) is specified in 
[index.html](https://github.com/sysapps/telephony/blob/gh-pages/index.html).

The folder 'input_docs' contains old, or alternative versions.
Any System Applications member can submit an alternative specification in the
input_docs folder.

The folder 'split_spec' contains the specification split into
- use cases and requirements
- a core part as 'index.html',
- extension for supporting multiple SIM/telephony services
- extension for supporting multiparty calls

All of these can be under separate development.
